# Goodreads-records-analysis
This is an analysis beased on a dataset of Goodreads data downloaded from Kaggle.

The key questions I would like to answer through analysis include:
1. More and more books published? Changes on numbers of books published through time;
2. Most productive author: The author has the highest number of published books;
3. Which book is the best? The book has the highest average rating (with and without adjusted by number of reviews);
4. Which book receives the most reviews?
5. Underrated gem: which book has a high rating but few reviews;
6. Which author has a overall highest rating?
7. Is there a correlation between the length of book and rating/number of reviews

Used python packages are: Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, Datetime, seaborn, scipy, sklearn.
conducted tasks include: cleaning data, correcting date, show descriptive statistics, ploting, flitering, sorting, string manipulation, regression.
used tools: Bayesian average, nonlinear regression.
